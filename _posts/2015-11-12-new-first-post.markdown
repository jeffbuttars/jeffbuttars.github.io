### New Post it says. 

I can't use this site until I post, so `POST` I will. Assuming of course it will be `POST`. Could be a `GET`, with a body. The `GET` body is very uncommon. After the `GET` with body method to query Elasticsearch (the first time I had done such a thing) I grew to like it. So underrated. Recently used the o'l `GET` with body professionally. Haven't caught flack for it, yet.
